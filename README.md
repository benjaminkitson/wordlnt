A clone of Wordle!

The game more or less works as expected - implementing backend stuff to make the daily word functionality will come soon!

Credit to Josh Wardle for this, big respect for keeping it classy, free, and for only permitting one puzzle per day. I assume he created this, given that Wordle and Wardle are basically the same word - relevant links below:
